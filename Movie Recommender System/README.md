# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using data from Kaggle. The system recommends movies similar to a user-specified movie based on various factors. The project also includes a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Features

- **Data Source:** The movie dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand the data patterns and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Recommendation Algorithm:** Implemented the Cosine Similarity algorithm to suggest five movies similar to the one provided by the user.
- **User Interface:** Built with Streamlit, allowing users to input a movie name and get instant movie recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion:** The dataset is imported and cleaned for further processing.
2. **EDA:** Various techniques are applied to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data.
3. **Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected for the recommendation model.
4. **Cosine Similarity:** The system calculates the cosine similarity between movies to find and recommend similar movies.
5. **Streamlit UI:** A user interface where users can input a movie title and get a list of five recommended movies based on the input.

## Installation and Usage
